<h3><p align="center">Building a foundation in electronics and microcontrollers</h3></p>
<p align="justify">Through this collection of guided projects we strive to build a strong component-based foundational knowlasdASzxz our focus beyond the foundational knowledge, lies in microcontrollers and sensors. Tools that allow us to measure and ask questions about the world around. 'Fest' represents our goal of creating a community of collaborators which can ask eachother and us questions, and edit this repository to expand and or clarify ideas. We believe that teaching eachother is the best way to learn and move forward.</p>

Included in the 2021 folder:
<ul>
  <li>List of all materials used</li>
  <li>Modules made with the items ordered</li>
  <li>Resources for learning embedded systems engineering basics</li>
</ul>
  <b>Goal (modules 1-4):</b> learn the necessary skills to deploy any Arduino-compatible sensor and troubleshoot any potential problems
  <br>
  <b>Goal (overarching):</b> learn the skills necessary to conceptualize, know what information to seek, design, and build any arduino-based creation

<p align="justify"><i>This project was birthed within the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). We'd like to thank MBARI as well as the brave Tech Festers, MBARI staff and interns, who chose to attend our first meeting. Your continued curiosity and interest sparked the growth and development of Tech Fest. Special thanks to the EE Tech Lab for their knowledge and electrical components. Lastly, there have been many who've created manuals to encourage the starry eyed tech enthusiast. Thanks to them we have a trove of information on anything electrically related. These are: SparkFun, Adafruit, Arduino.... </p></i>
