# Temperature 2 Light
### Materials: 
Computer, microcontroller (arduino, feather, etc.), USB to micro-USB cable, KY-001 Temperature Sensor, KY-009 RGB Full Color LED, resistors (110Ωx2, 180Ω), breadboard, wires, and a multimeter (for troubleshooting).
### Objective: 
Learn how to draw information from a sensor, then understand and manipulate the information. In this case we understand and manipulate the temperature values by assigning the values to colors and intensity in a light display.
