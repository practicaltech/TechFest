Q: Why are we using LED rather than a different type of light bulb? Why do different colors have a different resistance?  
A: LEDs are cheap, relatively straightforward, unidirectional (usually), have current limits, and offer feedback when we pass current through them. These attributes make the LED a foundational component which we can play around with and learn, without the risk of damaging a more expensive component or system. Some examples of how an LED might be beneficial for learning: 
  1. Turning on an LED on your board -> you are successfully communicating with the desired pin on your board
  2. Turning on an LED in a circuit (and keeping it on) -> you supplied an adequate amount of current to your LED in the correct direction
  3. Fading an LED -> you’ve successfully used a digital signal (when done with your board) to average the voltage being directed to your LED.
These examples can be extended into more complex projects to check if your system is functioning correctly (LED on, off, blinking, fading, etc.) and if it blows up, you only lost a couple of cents.

Q: What’s the difference between a resistor and a converter (something that converts to a different voltage)? Why do different countries use different voltages for plugs?

Q: What metal are the bread boards/ other components made of and does that matter?

Q: Why does it matter to connect resistors in parallel or series?

Q: Why do the number of coils in a resistor matter?

Q: Why do all the component parts end in -or?
