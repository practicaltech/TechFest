### Arduino IDE:
**Verify (checkmark)** - Compiles Arduino project before uploading project to the Arduino board.

**Upload (arrow pointing right)** - Compiles and uploads project directly to Arduino board. **Make sure to specify the correct board and port before uploading**, otherwise the IDE will either complain that it can’t find the port, or it’ll just be stuck on uploading (in the case of a wrong board) for a loooooong time. If it’s stuck, close and reopen your Arduino sketch. If the window isn’t responding (pressing ‘x’ doesn’t do anything), for Windows - open task manager (ctrl+shift+esc shortcut) and manually end the task.
