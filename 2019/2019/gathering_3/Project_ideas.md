1. Morse code machine: takes your digital output and converts it to printed words. https://www.hackster.io/vladakrsmanovic/arduino-morse-code-machine-709cc5
2. Speed changing light sequence: using a couple of LEDs and a pot you can make a light display that speeds up or down when you turn the pot.
3. Multi-pattern speed changing light sequence: using a switch, LEDs, and a button.
  1. Everytime the button is pressed the light pattern changes. In any of these patterns, turning the pot will speed up or down the pattern.
4. LED pong: make a light sequence that simulates a ball (light) moving from one end to the other. If the button is pressed, the light will bounce and you will gain a point, else, the light disappears and you lose. You can modify this program to change the rules, difficulty, scoring system, etc. https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-LED-Pong/
