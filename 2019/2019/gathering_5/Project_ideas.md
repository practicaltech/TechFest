1. Switch LEDs on and off using a potentiometer so that it looks like you are moving the light across a series of LEDs by turning the pot.
2. Measure voltage using your board ([turn your board into a voltmeter](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/next-tech-lab/voltmeter-using-arduino-00e7d1)).
3. Advanced: send an email to yourself when you receive input (button press, potentiometer turn, photo sensor, etc.).
