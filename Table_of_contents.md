## gathering_1: Getting Started  
### Communicate with your microcontroller and have it respond, first on your computer and then by turning on an LED.  
## gathering_2: Prototyping materials and electronics  
### Getting familiar with components regularly used in circuits and the testing equipment used to check them.  
## gathering_3: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Analog vs. Digital Signals  
### Learn about how power is sent, modulated, and interpreted by microcontrollers and electrical components.  
## gathering_4: Continuation/Recap of PWM and Analog vs. Digital signals + Introduction to Capacitors
