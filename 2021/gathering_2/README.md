### 1. Turn 'ON' an LED (battery)
***Note:** Wear your safety glasses for this excercise and STOP as soon as you feel any heat building in the components*
***Note_2:** The solutions to the questions can be found at the end of this page*

**Materials:**

Safety glasses, 9v battery (included in kit), and a Red LED (included in kit)

**Objective:** Turn on the LED using the battery

Questions to ask while trying to do this:

<ol type="i">
  <li>How?</li>
  <li>Why are the two protrusions sticking out of the battery different shapes?</li>
  <li>Why are the two wires sticking out of the LED different sizes?</li>
</ol>

Once you get the LED to flash
<ol type="i">
  <li>Is it still turning on?</li>
  <li>Why does it eventually stop working?</li>
  <li>Are we missing anything?</li>
</ol>


### 2. Protect your LED (resistors)

**Materials:**
Safety glasses, 9v battery (included in kit), 2 220ohm resistors (included in kit), and a NEW Red LED (included in kit)

### 4. Projects and moving forward

#### Look at the items in your kit, then look at the information provided for each on the Elegoo documents you downloaded and search the web for similar sensors. What draws your eye and imagination? What could you build if you put a few of these components together?

#### Check out these links for ideas:

<ol type="i">
  <li>Touch the 2 metal wires of the LED to the trminals of the 9v battery in the following orientation: long LED wire to circle, short LED wire to hexagon.</li>
  <li>They designate the two different terminals, positive (circle) and negative (hexagon)</li>
  <li>They designate the two different terminals, positive (longer) and negative (shorter)</li>
</ol>

Once you get the LED to flash
<ol type="i">
  <li>Is it still turning on?</li>
  <li>Why does it eventually stop working?</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>
