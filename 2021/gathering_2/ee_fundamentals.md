### 1. Circuit

A circuit is a closed loop. In EE, the loop may contain a variety of different components and it must be conductive, powered (have the ability to be powered), and closed for electricity to run through it.
1. Conductive - made of a metal with easily moveable valence electrons to allow for the movement of electrons. E.g. copper, silver, gold.
2. Powered - there needs to be something suppyling a force that induces the movement of electrons. E.g. battery, friction (static).
3. Closed - electrons can keep pushing eachother to create flow. A gap in the system would stop the flow of electricity (*unless gap gets ionized e.g. lightning, sparking*)

### 2. Current

In our definition of a circuit, we said it needed to be conductive/allow for the movement of valence electrons. Current is the movement of electrons through a system. It is measured in Amperes (A). Current is how many electrons are passing through a point in a unit of time.

### 3. Voltage

For a system to have current it needs something to induce the movement of the electrons. A difference in charges induces that movement. If there is an unequal distribution of positive and negative charges in a system, the charges will want to move to equalize. The difference in charges is voltage. The greater that difference, the greater the voltage and the greater the push on the electrons. *If the charge difference is high enough, valence electrons will be moved in normally non-conductive materials e.g. air, causing sparks and lightning.*
