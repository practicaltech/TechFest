# Sensors galore! gather information, add logic, manipulate

Revisited from last week:

1. [The LED at work (Arduino)]()

New:

2. [Add a button to LED + battery + resistors circuit]()
3. [Blink external LED with button (in circuit)]()
4. [Serial Monitor (Hello World)]()
5. [Read button press]()
6. [Blink external LED with button (out of circuit)]()


### 1. The LED at work (Arduino)
**Materials:** Arduino Mega2560 (included in kit), computer (with Arduino IDE installed), USB to USB A/B cable (included in kit), Red LED (included in kit), Resistors (included in kit), breadboard (included in kit), and jumper wires (included in kit).

**Objective:** Turn an external LED on and off using the Arduino Mega board.

**Instructions:**

<ol type="i">
  <li>Navigate to <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/Blink">Arduino 'Blink'</a></li>
  <li>Follow the guide</li>
  <li>Change the speed at which the external LED blinks</li>
</ol>
