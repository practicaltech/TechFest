# Wifi or Bluetooth (output)

This week we will be switching it up a bit. I will offer two challenges for you to choose from and less information to follow with. Nevertheless, I will still supply information and some hints/answers at the end. The goal is to troubleshoot through our chosen challenge with outside resources. There are more ways than one to get to the same result. This week it's all about collaboration and problem solving.

*This guide will draw on techniques learned in previous gatherings*

After setting up your new board, choose whether you want to work on Bluetooth or Wifi. I have added some pros and cons to each at the top of their respective sections.

3. [Wifi (control a light from anywhere in the world with your computer)]()
4. [Answers & Hints]()


### 1. Prep Arduino Nano 33 IoT

   </br><br>
</p>

**Materials:** Arduino Nano 33 IoT and USB to Micro USB cable.

**Objective:** Succesfully communicate with your board by running 'blink' on it.

**Instructions:**

  <ol type="i">
    <li>Navigate to the Nano 33 IoT page by clicking on the link under the image.</li>
    <li>Find and follow the 'getting started guide.' <b>Or</b>, look up the board name pn your search enginge and follow an independent hobbyists guide (sometimes they are better).</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If you chose the Arduino guide, follow the programming on 'Desktop IDE' guide.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Figure out how to make the on board LED blink! Look back to previous guides and/or follow the Arduino, Nano 33 IoT, guide's blink.</li>
  </ol>
  
  Congratulations!! you just got a whole new microcontroller working. The more experience we get with new boards, the more versatile we will become at working with and troubleshooting microcontrollers.

### 2. Bluetooth

Is a standardized communication protocol for electronic systems ([Spark Fun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bluetooth-basics/all)). In other words, it's a way in which electrical systems can speak to eachother wirelessly. It operates at the same band as Wifi (2.4GHz).

| Pros    | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Low cost  | Short range (<100m)      |
| Low power   | Small amounts of data      |
| Secure   |        |

<ol type="i">
  Some potential uses:
  <li>Send and receive data from a sensor station</li>
  <li>Control a car, robot, or robot arm remotely/<li>
  <li>Send or receive audio signals</li>
</ol>

**Materials:** Smartphone, Arduino Nano 33 IoT, and USB to Micro USB cable.

**Challenge:** Turn on or off the onboard LED using your phone.

**Intro hints:**

<ol type="i">
  <li>Find a guide for our specific board or a <i>compatible one</i></li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Use the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=arduino+nano+33+iot+guide&rlz=1C1NHXL_esMX723MX731&oq=arduino+nano+33+iot+guide&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.6049j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Goog</a>. There are more ways than one to make this work.</li>
      </ol>
  <li>Control a car, robot, or robot arm remotely/<li>
  <li>Send or receive audio signals</li>
</ol>
