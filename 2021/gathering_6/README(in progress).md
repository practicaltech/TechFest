# Wifi or Bluetooth (output)

This week we will be switching it up a bit. I will offer two challenges for you to choose from and less information to follow with. Nevertheless, I will still supply information and some hints/answers at the end. The goal is to troubleshoot through our chosen challenge with outside resources. There are more ways than one to get to the same result. This week it's all about collaboration and problem solving.

*This guide will draw on techniques learned in previous gatherings*

After setting up your new board, choose whether you want to work on Bluetooth or Wifi. I have added some pros and cons to each at the top of their respective sections.

**Materials:** Arduino Nano 33 IoT and USB to Micro USB cable.

**Objective:** Succesfully communicate with your board by running 'blink' on it.

**Instructions:**

  <ol type="i">
    <li>Navigate to the Nano 33 IoT page by clicking on the link under the image.</li>
    <li>Find and follow the 'getting started guide.' <b>Or</b>, look up the board name pn your search enginge and follow an independent hobbyists guide (sometimes they are better).</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If you chose the Arduino guide, follow the programming on 'Desktop IDE' guide.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Figure out how to make the on board LED blink! Look back to previous guides and/or follow the Arduino, Nano 33 IoT, guide's blink.</li>
  </ol>
  
  Congratulations!! you just got a whole new microcontroller working. The more experience we get with new boards, the more versatile we will become at working with and troubleshooting microcontrollers.
